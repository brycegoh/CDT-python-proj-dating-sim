After school studying
Girl: Argh I can't take this anymore! Exams are so stressful, I feel like I'm going to combust!
Girl: How --NAME-- how...I really don't know how you do it sia...

1. Why not study together? I can help explain stuff you don't understand.
2. I think you need a good study break, let's go and shoot some hoops to destress.
3. Oh man, jiayous. I myself need to study on my own to buck up.

Girl: Alrites then!
